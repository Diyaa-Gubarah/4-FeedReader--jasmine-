# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

# Steps to run the application
* You could simply clone or download this repository and run the **index.html** file
* after page loaded you should see in the bottom of the page the result of jasmine test passed with green color in each test
* you can click the Hemberger icon to select from available RSS Feeds
* you can add more RSS Feeds by add more objects into `allFeeds` array inside **app.js**
